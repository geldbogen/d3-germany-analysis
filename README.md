An interactive map of germany with the birthplaces of the most famous people from there. I used the wikidata query service (https://query.wikidata.org) to fetch the data (birthplaces, names, number of wikipedialanguages etc.) and made an interactive visualization with the help of d3 (https://d3js.org/) in JavaScript.

Use the two sliders on the left side to confine the view on 
  Year of birth (left slider)
  and 
  Number of wikipedia-languages ("how famous is the person") (right slider)
  
Hover over the points to see name,number of wikipedia-languages and year of birth.
